# Spinny-cube-in-C-SFML
Draws a cursed looking cube in 3d space using SFML library
Ignore the fact that the source file name has the words - "with image" - in it, that is a future update or something when I work out how to. 
But for now it is just a 3d cube thing that spins and looks very broken because of how I chose to colour it... Also if you want to compile
the code yourself you will need to get sfml library and link it etc from https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php - (I used sfml 2.5.1 compiled for 32 bit visual C++ 15 (2017))
